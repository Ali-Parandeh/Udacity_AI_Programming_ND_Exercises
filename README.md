# Udacity AI Programming Nanodegree
A collection of exercises and mini-projects I have completed as part of my Udacity AI Programming Nanodegree Programme.

The nanodegree included a series of projects, mini-projects and quizes which are included in this repo.

### Projects
- Develop a python programme to compare performance of three pre-trained classifiers in classifying dogs and their breeds.
- Develop your own image classifier from scratch using pytorch to classify flowers by their types
- Develop a command line application to allow others to use the flower classifier

### Mini-Projects
- Implementing OOP for Clothing
- Implementing Gaussian Distributions with OOP
- Implementing Inheritance OOP for Clothing
- Implementing Inheritance for Probability Distributions
- Undertaking Mean Normalization and Data Separation with Numpy
- Developing Statistics From Stock Data with Pandas
- Visualising Data with Bar Charts, Histograms, Scatter plot, Violin and Box Plot,  Scales and Transformations, Categorical Plot with Matplotlib
- Vectors Lab, Linear Combination Lab, Linear Mapping Lab
- Implementing Gradient Descent
- Predicting Student Admissions with Neural Networks
- Deep Learning with Pytorch
  - **Part 1:** Introduction to PyTorch and using tensors
  - **Part 2:** Building a fully-connected neural networks with PyTorch
  - **Part 3:** Training a fully-connected network with backpropagation on MNIST (Handwritten Digits)
  - **Part 4:** Training neural network on Fashion-MNIST
  - **Part 5:** Using a trained network for making predictions and validating networks, Implementing Dropout to avoid overfitting
  - **Part 6:** Saving and loading trained models
  - **Part 7:** Loading image data with torchvision, also data augmentation
