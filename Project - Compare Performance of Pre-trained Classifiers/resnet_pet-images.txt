The model used for this classification is 'resnet'.

The overall count of the images include: 
 Number of Images:                     40
 Number of dog images:                 30
 Number of 'Not-a' dog images:         10

The statistics value of percentages include:
 % of Correct Dogs:                            100.0
 % of Correct Breed:                           90.0
 % of Correct 'Not-a' Dog:                     90.0
 % of label Matches (dog and not-a-dog):       82.5

Incorrect dog classifications:

Pet Image:                            cat   classifier label:   norwegian elkhound, elkhound

Incorrect breed classifications:

Pet Image:                 great pyrenees   classifier label:                     kuvasz
Pet Image:                         beagle   classifier label: walker hound, walker foxhound
Pet Image:               golden retriever   classifier label:                   leonberg

Using the 40 pet images, VGG had the highest accuracy (100% in classifying the dog vs non-dog images and 93.3% in percentage of correct dog breed classification. It managed to classify all 40 images to 87.5% accuracy. Other classifiers, Alexnet and Resnet managed to classify all images by 75% and 82.5% respectively. Therefore, Alexnet is worse than Resnet in than classifying dogs and dog breeds but better than Resnet at classifying non-dogs. VGG is 10 times slower than both Alexnet and Resnet classifiers but the most accurate classifier.
